After a century of welcoming audiences to the Picture House, earlier this year our Grade II listed lamppost was temporarily moved off-site. Years of exposure to the elements and some structural damage now mean it’s in need of specialist attention.

By sponsoring the lamppost for £15, you can help us carry out critical repairs to the cast iron, as well as some much needed rewiring and redecoration. Once completed the lamppost will be reinstated in its original position, looking as good as it did when it left the Saracen Foundry in Glasgow in 1914.

And as a thank you, you’ll receive a limited-edition pin badge, featuring an illustration of the lamppost by Adam Allsuch Boardman. These make nifty gifts at this time of year, and also come with a commemorative postcard.

With only two weeks left on our Winter Fundraiser, and less than 100 pin badges remaining, now’s the perfect time to become a proud sponsor of this iconic piece of Picture House history!
