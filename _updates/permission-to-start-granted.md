Today we're thrilled to announce that after two years of development, the National Lottery Heritage Fund have given the green-light to The Picture House Project.

Confirmation of £2.3million of National Lottery investment - plus support from Leeds City Council, means work will  begin later this year.

Thanks to everyone who’s taken part in consultation and supported the project so far. We’re very excited to begin 2019 with this great news and can’t wait to get started!
