Today the cinema's newly repaired facade was revealed, following the removal of the scaffolding from the front of the building.With repairs to the faience blocks, stonework, brickwork and roof â€“ the facade is now looking better than it has done for years. 

Some final brick repointing, and cleaning will take place ahead of the cinema's grand reopening.
