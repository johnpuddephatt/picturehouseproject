Today the cinema's iconic Grade II listed lamppost has been reinstated, following repair and restoration work by Heritage Project Contracts in Shrewsbury. 

The lamp will soon be rewired, before its refurbished globes are reattached. 

The lamp will remain covered in protective material until closer to the cinema's reopening.
