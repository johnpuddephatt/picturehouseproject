For today’s project update, we wanted to share with you some of the work that’s been happening outside in recent days.  
  
Ahead of the construction of our new extension, new foundations are currently being established to support the structure.   
  
In these photos you can see the introduction of new pile foundations, with rebar cages being installed at the top. These cages will provide reinforcement for the concrete capping beam that will be poured in the next week or so.
