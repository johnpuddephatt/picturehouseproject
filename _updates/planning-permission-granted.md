Today, following months of development and consultation with audiences and partners from across the city, we’re delighted to announce that Planning Permission and Listed Building Consent has been granted for The Picture House Project.

This ambitious and vital redevelopment project – supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Leeds City Council and the Friends of Hyde Park – aims to both preserve and protect our historic building, whilst making it more accessible, sustainable and secure for generations to come.
