Following yesterday’s video from our roof, today our Mark from Page\\Park talks about our façade, and one of the most exciting elements of conservation work happening on The Picture House Project.  
  
Huge thanks to Darwen Terracotta, Building Restoration and Clean and Triton Construction for doing such a brilliant job of producing and installing our new replacement faience blocks.  
  
And thanks to both the National Lottery Heritage Fund and everyone who sponsored this crucial work as part of our Winter Fundraiser. The wonderful Sunken Studio are shipping the very last of the handmade decorative tiles today for those who kindly donated.  
  
If you enjoy seeing these conservation updates then we have some more to come over the next few days, so check back soon!
