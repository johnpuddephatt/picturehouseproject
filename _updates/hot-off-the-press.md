Exciting news! Hiding in Plain Sight – our heritage project celebrating the Lost cinemas of Leeds – is now a book!

Published by Colours May Vary, the book is the first title in their new *Editions* series, and features 70 of Adam Allsuch Boardman’s wonderful cinema illustrations.

Supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Leeds Inspired, with meticulous research from Laura Ager, the Hiding in Plain Sight project can also be explored online via an interactive microsite produced by Let’s Dance Agency: lostcinemas.co.u.k

The book is now available to buy at Colours May Vary, as well as via our website’s online shop.

Big thanks to Saul Studio and G.F. Smith Papers for bringing the book to life, and Justin Lee for the lovely photos.

We’re so delighted that this project continues to grow and evolve, and we can’t wait to share with you its next iteration later this summer!
