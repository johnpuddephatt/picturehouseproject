With at least 80 cinemas once existing in Leeds & only a handful now remaining, it begs the question: where have all our cinemas gone? The answer is, they’re all around us – you just need to know where to look!

Hiding in Plain Sight – our exciting new heritage project, produced in collaboration with Adam Allsuch Boardman – is now live! Our new interactive microsite lostcinemas.co.uk, produced by Let's Dance Agency, allows users to navigate the city and visit the locations of dozens of past cinemas, many of which have survived and are still visible today.

Cinemas which have long been closed but can still be seen include Kirkstall's Abbey Picture House, the Clock Cinema in Harehills and Leeds city centre’s iconic Majestic Cinema – to name just a few!

Alongside illustrations and archive photographs – many of which have been provided by Leeds Libraries from their Leodis archive – visitors to the website will also be able to contribute to the project directly by submitting memories or photos they have of specific cinema venues.

Also opening today is accompanying exhibition at Colours May Vary. On display are the colourful and detailed new illustrations from Adam – with 12 prints featuring the artist’s favourite cinemas.

Supported by Leeds Inspired and the National Lottery Heritage Fund, the aim is for the project to become a living archive, which continues to grow and evolve through ongoing engagement with Leeds residents, old and new.

We’re certain there are more cinemas out there which haven’t yet been included. Help us find them!
