Following the removal of our 20 year old carpet from the foyer, and the 1960s vinyl tiles underneath, we’re delighted to see that the cinema’s original terrazzo floor is largely intact and (despite a few cracks) in really great condition.   
  
Work will soon begin to repair small sections, as well as the whole floor receiving a light sand and polish, bringing it back to its former glory.   
  
A simple mop reveals just how colourful the terrazzo will be once the dust and dirt is removed, and the restoration work is complete.   
  
The Picture House Project is is only possible thanks to support from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.
