The very latest from week’s site visit.

The basement groundworks are nearing completion, ahead of the steel frame for the new extension going up from next week.

A new acoustic partition and (asbestos-free!) proscenium arch have gone up in the auditorium - including a new and improved stage.

External scaffolding means that work can begin on the repair and restoration of the cinema’s roof and façade.
