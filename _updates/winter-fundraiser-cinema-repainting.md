By donating to our Winter Fundraiser you’ll help us to carry out essential conservation work, including the introduction of a new, sensitive colour scheme into the building.  
  
We spoke with our project architect Mark from Page\\Park about how our approach is being carefully informed by a renewed understanding of the building’s long history.  
  
As a thank you for sponsoring the repainting of the cinema, you’ll receive two limited edition A3 prints, featuring images taken from our recent paint survey. For more details on these and other ways you can support the campaign, head to our website.
