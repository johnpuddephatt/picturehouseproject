Today we’re thrilled to launch The Picture House Winter Fundraiser!   
  
Over the next 6 weeks we're asking you, our wonderful community, to help us deliver vital conservation work as part of The Picture House Project.  
  
Between now and Christmas you’ll have the opportunity to sponsor specific areas of upcoming conservation work – from the repainting of our auditorium to the restoration of our Grade II Listed lamppost. And as a thank you to those who donate, we’ve produced several limited-edition rewards, including pin badges, prints and decorative tiles.  
  
You might be wondering – why are we asking for support, isn’t the project already funded? While we’re enormously grateful for the National Lottery Heritage Fund grant we’ve received, we’ve always needed to raise additional match-funding to make our plans a reality. And after this past year, the additional money we need to raise has only increased due to COVID. So with the cinema’s reopening in sight, we thought now was the right time to reach out to you, and ask for your support at this crucial time.
