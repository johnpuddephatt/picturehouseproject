Our Winter Fundraiser is now closed. We’ve been overwhelmed by your generosity these past six weeks and thanks to 820 individual donations, we’ve raised an incredible £53,686!  
  
To everyone who’s sponsored the cinema this winter, a huge heartfelt thank you.   
  
We can’t wait to share with you all the conservation work due to take place next year – all made possible thanks to your generous support.  
  
Until then, Seasons Greetings and a very Merry Christmas from the whole Picture House team. Whatever you’re up to, have a wonderful weekend!
