Prior to work starting on The Picture House Project, our roof vent – which proudly sits at the very top of the cinema – was in serious need of repair. Now, following conservation works, we think it’s looking rather lovely.   
  
These before and after shots below are a great reminder of just how much the cinema was in need of repair prior to work beginning on the project. So over the coming weeks, we look forward to sharing with you more examples of conservation work that’s been taking place across the building, as we move towards the final stages of the project.
