Opening on the 2nd of November 1914, just three months after the commencement of the First World War, the Hyde Park Picture House is one of only a handful of early cinemas still operating today. Our rich 102-year long history has been full to the brim of on and off-screen drama including two world wars, closure threats, celebrity guests and more than a few changes to the way audiences watch and enjoy films. We’ve seen marriage proposals and weddings, we’ve been a location for film and TV and we’ve been the formative cinema experience for scores of young audiences as they discover the world through the medium of film.

At the heart of our good fortune sit two key things, our beautiful Grade II listed building and the film-loving community of Leeds, who have helped to ensure we are still a vibrant and relevant venue more than a century after we first opened our doors. But we’re not complacent and know that our continued survival relies on more than goodwill, but an ambitious plan for a bright and sustainable future.

It is for this reason that we are thrilled to announce that the Heritage Lottery Fund have agreed to support our exciting regeneration project. This invaluable support brings £2.4million of lottery investment, including £122,000 in development funding, to help us to protect and restore our existing building, and find a bold and innovative way to ensure it continues to thrive over the next 100 years.
