Today is temporary moving day for our Grade II listed lamppost.

Before anyone worries it has disappeared for good, we want to reassure you that it will definitely return, looking better than ever.

The lamppost is now in the very safe hands of conservation specialists, who will be working their magic over the coming months, carrying out expert repair work and bringing it back to its former ornate glory.
