In September 2021, the Hyde Park Picture House and This Way Up Conference asked artist and filmmaker Joe Goff to visit the cinema and produce a short film. The result is a snapshot of the Picture House at a unique and transitional period in its history â€“ with individuals connected to cinema discussing their feelings of apprehension, excitement and hope during this unusual time.
