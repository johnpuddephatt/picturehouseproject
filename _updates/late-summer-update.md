There’s been some good progress on The Picture House Project this week!

The installation of new external brickwork on our extension is now well underway.

Props have been removed throughout the building following the successful installation of new load bearing steels, allowing for the expansion of the foyer and basement.

Replastering and repainting has been carried out in areas throughout the building, including the ceiling above the main entrance.

There’s some exciting work around the corner too – including connecting the existing building with the extension, the repainting of the auditorium and revealing the original terazzo tiles in our foyer for the first time!
