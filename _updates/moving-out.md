With two weeks to go before work on The Picture House Project properly begins – we’re busy sorting through an Aladdin’s cave of ‘stuff’ we’ve accumulated over the years.   
  
From analogue projection equipment and old ice cream freezers, to film posters and past cinema brochures, we’re keeping hold of the bits that are important to the cinema and our history, and finding new homes for everything else.

We're also starting to reveal some parts of the cinema we've rarely seen before – including the original proscenium arch behind our current screen, and the original terrazzo tiles underneath the carpets of our foyer. We can't wait to continue revealing more over the coming months!
