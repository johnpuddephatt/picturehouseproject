For the last in our recent series of conservation updates, Mark from Page/Park talks through some of the recent stone repairs that have been carried out by Building, Restoration and Clean for the project.   
  
We look forward to sharing some more videos in the coming months, focusing on some of the conservation work taking place inside the cinema, including to our gas lights, plasterwork and original flooring.
