I"Ä<p>Located at the foot of the cinemaâ€™s main doors are our terrazzo tiles, complete with beautiful marble and granite mosaic detailing. Considering the many feet itâ€™s seen over the years itâ€™s in remarkably good shape, though time has been kinder to some sections than others. Green sections of the design are almost worn away, and as part of The Picture House Project, weâ€™ll be keen to restore and preserve as much of this tiling as we can.</p>
