I"È<p>The small ticket booth at the front has been home to the cinemaâ€™s box office for many years.</p>

<p>However during periods of the cinemaâ€™s long history, the box office was brought inside, to where the kiosk is currently located, to prevent patrons from having to queue outside.</p>

<p>The Picture House Project aims to preserve the historic ticket booth, while the day-to-day function of a box office may be moved to a more suitable location.</p>
