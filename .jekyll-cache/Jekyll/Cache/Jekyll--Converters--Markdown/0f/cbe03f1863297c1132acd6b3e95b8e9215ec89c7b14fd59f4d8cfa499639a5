I"š<p>Located in the foyer, where the snack kiosk currently stands, is the remnants of a grand fireplace which existed during the cinemaâ€™s early years. Once responsive for providing the bulk of the cinemaâ€™s heating, the fireplace would have warmed both the foyer and auditorium behind it.</p>
