I"™<p>A section of the Picture House rarely seen by visitors is its large basement â€“ which spans the entire footprint of the building. This is where the original managerâ€™s office was located, with the managerâ€™s phone - used to communicate with staff upstairs - still hung on the wall.</p>

<p>The reason this office was located in the basement and not above ground, was due to there being even less space on the upper floors than there is today. When bulky electrical generators and projection equipment were removed from the room adjacent to the projection booth, the managerâ€™s office was positioned there instead - which is where it remains to this day.</p>
