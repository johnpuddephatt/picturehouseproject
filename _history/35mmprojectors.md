The cinema’s two Cinemeccanica 35mm projectors are still located in the cinema’s projection room, and continue to be operated on a weekly basis. Manufactured in the 1960s, they were originally installed at the Odeon cinema in Grimsby, and then the Lounge in Headingley, before finding their home at the Hyde Park Picture House in 2005.

The machines have been well maintained over the years by a team of trained projectionists, and allow the cinema to project a large number of classic and archive films that many other cinemas can now no longer screen.
