One of the cinema’s most unique and significant heritage features are our nine gas lights, located within our auditorium and foyer.

Originally installed as a form of ‘modesty lighting’ to prevent any inappropriate back-seat behaviour, they’re now a symbol of the cinema’s Edwardian origins and continue to be lit every single day.

While the lamps have been well maintained over the years, they’re now in need of extensive restoration in order to ensure they can continue flicking in our aisles for many years to come.
