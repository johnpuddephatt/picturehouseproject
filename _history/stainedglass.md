The window next to the staircase is home to one of our decorative glass panels, an original featuring dating back to 1914. Close inspection reveals it is part stained glass and part hand painted.

For many of the cinema’s staff it’s their favourite part of the building – particularly during the summer months, when morning sunlight streams through the panels and casts a colourful beam of light gracefully across the stairs.
