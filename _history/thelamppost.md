Our ornamental lamppost is an iconic part of the Picture House and like the main building, it is also Grade II listed. Originally a gas-lit, the lamp is now powered by electricity.

It was manufactured by W. MacFarlane & Co, also known as the Saracen Foundry, renowned at the time as the most important manufacturer of ornamental ironwork in Scotland. And as part of The Picture House Project, we hope to restore some of the more intricate detailing on the lamp, and helping to return it back to its former splendour.
