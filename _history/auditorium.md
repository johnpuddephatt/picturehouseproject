The main auditorium is not exactly as it was in 1914 but we are fortunate that no extreme alterations have been made. Many objects such as the clock, the proscenium arch and the lighting fittings were installed at different points in the cinemaâ€™s long life - each referencing quite specific historical eras.

Many elements of the auditorium remain unchanged from 1914, including the location of the gas lamps and the ornate plasterwork that decorates the ceiling and front of the balcony.
