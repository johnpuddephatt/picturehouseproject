While today we’re fully fitted with contemporary fire-fighting equipment, none of that makes quite the same statement as our original fire hydrant, located by the main doors.

The existence of such an object has significant historical relevance. The 1909 Cinematograph Act, which led to the creation of the UK’s first purpose build cinemas, was passed in response to a number if disastrous fires that took place in temporary exhibition spaces. The flammable nature of early nitrate film meant that cinemas were at greater risk from fire than typical public buildings, leading to extensive equipment like this hydrant being installed.

Luckily the hydrant has never been used in a fire-fighting situation, but following a test a number of years ago, we know that it is still functional. And since the water comes straight from the mains, the force of the hose is quite impressive, and enough to throw the user to the ground!
