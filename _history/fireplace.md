Located in the foyer, where the snack kiosk currently stands, is the remnants of a grand fireplace which existed during the cinema’s early years. Once responsive for providing the bulk of the cinema’s heating, the fireplace would have warmed both the foyer and auditorium behind it.

Sadly we have no photos of this original fireplace but we do have a drawing that helps fill in the details.
