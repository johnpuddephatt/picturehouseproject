The art-deco clock you see to the right of the screen has sat proudly in our auditorium since the 1950s. Prior to that it lived in the Gaumont cinema in Leeds City Centre – which is now the O2 Academy. Len Thompson, the cinema’s general manager at the time, saved the clock when the Gaumont sadly closed – along with some seats, and toilet signs.
