The small ticket booth at the front has been home to the cinema’s box office for many years.

However during periods of the cinema’s long history, the box office was brought inside, to where the kiosk is currently located, to prevent patrons from having to queue outside.

The Picture House Project aims to preserve the historic ticket booth, while the day-to-day function of a box office may be moved to a more suitable location.
