One of the biggest improvements to the Picture House will be the creation of a new cafe/bar area, located within a ground-floor extension, which runs alongside the existing building.

This space will allow visitors to enjoy refreshments before or after the film – or simply pop in for a drink with friends. It means no more waiting outside in the cold if you arrive early – helping to make the cinema more open, accessible and welcoming for our community.
